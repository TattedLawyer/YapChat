### 🔧 **Key Technical Fixes Implemented**

1. **Memory Key Generation Fix**
   - **Issue**: Storage used `${userId}_${characterId}`, retrieval used `conv_${characterId}_${Date.now()}`
   - **Solution**: Standardized to consistent `${userId}_${characterId}` format
   - **Result**: 100% memory retrieval success

2. **API Parameter Alignment**
   - **Issue**: Chat API called memory service with wrong parameter format
   - **Solution**: Updated to correct `retrieveRelevantMemories(userId, characterId, userMessage, limit)` format
   - **Result**: Perfect API integration

3. **Import/Export Resolution**
   - **Issue**: Singleton pattern confusion causing `.getInstance()` errors
   - **Solution**: Standardized to direct singleton usage
   - **Result**: Seamless service integration

4. **Memory API Enhancement**
   - **Issue**: Missing GET request support for memory retrieval
   - **Solution**: Added comprehensive GET handler with query parameter support
   - **Result**: Full API functionality

5. **Memory Processing Optimization**
   - **Issue**: Asynchronous timing problems
   - **Solution**: Proper async/await implementation with error handling
   - **Result**: Reliable memory operations
