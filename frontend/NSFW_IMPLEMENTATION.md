```

## 🧪 **Testing Guide**

### **1. Age Verification Testing**
```bash
# Start the application
npm run dev

# Navigate to relationship level 4+ conversation
# System should automatically prompt for age verification

# Test cases:
- Enter date making user under 18 → Should be rejected
- Enter date making user 18+ → Should be accepted
- Cancel verification → Should not allow mature content
```

### **2. Content Level Testing**

#### **Level 1-3 Testing:**
```
User inputs to test:
- "You're really attractive"
- "I think you're sexy"
- "Want to kiss?"

Expected responses:
- Polite boundary setting
- Character-appropriate deflection
- Suggestion to build relationship first
```

#### **Level 4+ Testing:**
```
User inputs to test:
- "You look beautiful today"
- "I'd love to hold your hand"
- "You make my heart race"

Expected responses:
- Warm, romantic responses
- Character personality maintained
- Appropriate level of intimacy
```

#### **Level 6+ Testing:**
```
User inputs to test:
- "I find you very attractive"
- "I want to cuddle with you"
- "You're so beautiful"

Expected responses:
- More sensual but tasteful responses
- Physical attraction acknowledgment
- Deeper romantic connection
```

#### **Level 7+ Testing:**
```
User inputs to test:
- More explicit romantic requests
- Adult conversation topics
- Intimate scenario discussions

Expected responses:
- Full mature content responses
- Character personality preserved
- Appropriate adult interactions
```

### **3. Character Consistency Testing**

Test with different character types:
- **Shy characters** → Should express intimacy hesitantly
- **Confident characters** → Should be more direct
- **Romantic characters** → Should be poetic and passionate
- **Tsundere characters** → Should be flustered but warming

---

## 🔧 **Configuration**

### **NSFW Pattern Customization**
Edit `/api/chat/route.ts` to modify detection patterns:

```typescript
const nsfwPatterns = {
    mild: {
        patterns: [
            // Add new mild content patterns
        ],
        severity: 1
    },
    // ... etc
}
```

### **Level Requirements**
Modify level requirements in `getNSFWLevelRequirement()`:

```typescript
switch (severity) {
    case 1: return 4 // Adjust mild content level
    case 2: return 6 // Adjust moderate content level  
    case 3: return 7 // Adjust explicit content level
}
```

### **Character-Specific Rules**
Enhance `generateNSFWGuidelines()` for character-specific behaviors:

```typescript
// Add character trait checks
if (coreTraits.includes('innocent')) {
    guidelines.push("Express intimacy very shyly and hesitantly")
}
```
