## Critical Issues Requiring Resolution

### üö® Priority 1: Memory System Performance
**Issue:** Memory retrieval latency exceeds acceptable thresholds by 80x
- **Current:** 8,088ms average retrieval time
- **Target:** <100ms
- **Impact:** Unacceptable user experience, conversation flow disruption

**Recommended Actions:**
1. Implement vector database query optimization
2. Add memory caching layer with Redis
3. Optimize embedding similarity search algorithms
4. Consider memory pre-loading for active conversations

### üö® Priority 2: Memory Recall Accuracy
**Issue:** System failing to recall previously stored information
- **Current:** 0% job information recall
- **Target:** >95% recall accuracy
- **Impact:** Breaks conversation continuity, reduces companion effectiveness

**Recommended Actions:**
1. Debug memory extraction-to-retrieval pipeline
2. Verify vector embedding consistency
3. Implement memory consolidation verification
4. Add memory retrieval testing in CI/CD

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Priority 3: Load Performance Optimization
**Issue:** Response times degrade significantly under concurrent load
- **Current:** 1,429ms under load vs ~750ms normal
- **Target:** <300ms under load
- **Impact:** Poor scalability for production traffic

**Recommended Actions:**
1. Implement connection pooling for database
2. Add horizontal scaling for API endpoints
3. Optimize Claude API request batching
4. Consider CDN for static assets
