## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Memory Retrieval Latency Issues
**Symptoms:** Tests timing out, 8+ second response times
**Solutions:**
1. Check Supabase connection and vector database performance
2. Verify embedding generation isn't blocking
3. Implement memory caching layer
4. Optimize vector similarity search queries

### Memory Recall Accuracy Problems  
**Symptoms:** System not remembering previously shared information
**Solutions:**
1. Verify memory extraction is working in chat API
2. Check vector embedding consistency
3. Debug memory storage and retrieval pipeline
4. Validate conversation context building

### Performance Degradation Under Load
**Symptoms:** Response times increase significantly with concurrent users
**Solutions:**
1. Implement database connection pooling
2. Add horizontal scaling capabilities
3. Optimize Claude API request handling
4. Consider caching frequently accessed data

### Security Test Failures
**Symptoms:** Injection attacks not properly handled
**Solutions:**
1. Review input validation and sanitization
2. Implement proper SQL query parameterization
3. Add XSS protection headers
4. Validate API endpoint security

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Test Scenarios
```javascript
// Add custom conversation scenarios
TEST_DATA.conversations.push({
    scenario: "custom_scenario",
    messages: [
        "Your custom test message 1",
        "Your custom test message 2"
    ]
});
```

### Extended Performance Testing
```javascript
// Increase load testing parameters
CONFIG.CONCURRENT_USERS = 50;
CONFIG.TEST_DURATION = 60000; // 1 minute
```

### Custom Monitoring Metrics
```javascript
// Add custom monitoring checks
async function customMonitoringCheck() {
    // Your custom monitoring logic
    return {
        passed: true,
        metrics: { customMetric: "value" }
    };
}
```

### Webhook Integration
Set environment variable for Slack/Discord alerts:
```bash
export ALERT_WEBHOOK_URL="https://hooks.slack.com/your-webhook-url"
```

## Best Practices

### Development Workflow
1. Run production readiness tests before each release
2. Monitor key metrics continuously in staging
3. Set up automated alerts for critical thresholds
4. Review test results in pull request comments
5. Update test scenarios based on user feedback

### Performance Optimization
1. Profile memory retrieval pipeline regularly
2. Monitor cost per engagement trends
3. Optimize based on real user conversation patterns
4. Implement caching for frequently accessed memories
5. Consider memory pre-loading for active users

### Security Maintenance
1. Update security test vectors quarterly
2. Review and test new attack patterns
3. Validate security controls after code changes
4. Monitor for emerging threats and vulnerabilities
5. Conduct periodic security assessments
