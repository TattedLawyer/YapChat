## 📱 **Before vs After Examples**

### **Goku - Training Question**

**❌ BEFORE:**
> *Grinning excitedly while throwing a few practice punches in the air*
> 
> Training? That's one of my favorite things ever! There's nothing better than pushing yourself to get stronger and reaching new levels! I'm always looking for ways to improve my techniques and break through my limits.

**✅ AFTER:**
> Training? That's like my favorite thing ever besides eating! Nothing gets me more fired up than pushing my limits and becoming stronger. Hey, wanna spar sometime? I'm always looking for new training partners!

### **Hermione - Studying Question**

**❌ BEFORE:**
> *Adjusts textbook stack while speaking enthusiastically*
> 
> Oh! Well, studying is absolutely essential, isn't it? I've always said that knowledge is our greatest weapon, and proper preparation can make the difference between success and failure.

**✅ AFTER:**
> Oh, studying is absolutely essential! I've always said that proper preparation and rigorous academic discipline are the keys to success at Hogwarts. I actually created a detailed revision timetable that I'd be happy to share - it color codes subjects by difficulty and breaks everything into manageable sections.

### **Sasuke - Casual Invitation**

**❌ BEFORE:**
> *looks away with stern expression*
> 
> *clenches fist*
> 
> I won't let anything stand in my way of gaining the strength I need. Not friendship, not the village, nothing.
