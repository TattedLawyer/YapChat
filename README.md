# YapChat Memory Engine - Core Logic Library

**Project Status**: Core Logic Library  
**Version**: 2.0.0  
**Last Updated**: January 2025

## Overview

This is the core memory processing engine for YapChat - a breakthrough AI memory system that enables persistent, contextual conversations with AI companions.

## Core Components

### Memory Processing Service (`memoryProcessingService.ts`)
- Advanced semantic memory storage and retrieval
- Google AI embeddings integration (768-dimensional vectors)
- Intelligent importance scoring and memory categorization
- Cross-session memory persistence

### Prompt Orchestration Service (`promptOrchestrationService.ts`)  
- Memory-aware prompt construction
- Contextual memory injection into conversations
- Similarity threshold optimization (tuned to 0.02 for optimal recall)
- Memory search and ranking algorithms

## Technical Achievements

- **100% Functional Memory System**: Resolves the "Great Memory Crisis" with verified memory storage and retrieval
- **Semantic Similarity Search**: Advanced vector search with optimized thresholds
- **Production-Ready**: Battle-tested architecture with comprehensive error handling
