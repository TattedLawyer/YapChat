## 🏗️ **Technical Architecture**

### 🧠 **AI & Memory System**
```typescript
// Memory Service Architecture
class MemoryService {
  // Optimized storage with consistent key generation
  storeMemories(userId, characterId, conversation) {
    const key = `${userId}_${characterId}` // Consistent key format
    // Extract meaningful memories with importance scoring
    // Cache with 5-minute TTL for performance
  }
  
  // Fast retrieval with keyword-based similarity
  retrieveMemories(userId, characterId, query) {
    // Sub-5ms retrieval using optimized search
    // Smart fallback for graceful degradation
    // Performance monitoring and metrics
  }
}
```

**Key Features:**
- **Provider**: Anthropic Claude 3.5 Sonnet for optimal quality
- **Memory Storage**: In-memory caching with persistent conversation data
- **Retrieval Speed**: <5ms average with keyword-based similarity matching
- **Context Awareness**: Maintains conversation continuity across sessions
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful fallback with smart memory generation

### 💾 **Data & State Management**
```typescript
// Frontend Architecture
- Next.js 14 with TypeScript for type safety
- React Context for global state management  
- Local Storage for user preferences and session data
- Memory Service integration for conversation continuity
- Real-time character profile updates based on interactions
```

### 🔄 **Relationship Progression Algorithm**
```typescript
// XP Calculation with Memory Integration
const calculateXPRequired = (level: number): number => {
  const baseXP = 123
  const exponential = Math.pow(level, 2.2)
  const multiplier = getMultiplier(level)
  return Math.floor(baseXP * exponential * multiplier)
}

// Memory-Enhanced Progression Tiers
Levels 1-5:   Friendship building (123-786 XP)
Levels 6-10:  Romance development (1,403-2,242 XP)  
Levels 11-15: Deep relationship (3,432-5,695 XP)
Levels 16-20: Intimate partnership (7,585-11,714 XP)

// Memory influences progression speed and relationship depth
```

### 🛡️ **Security & Safety Implementation**
```typescript
// Triple-Layer Protection System
1. Age Verification: Collected during personality test, permanently stored
2. Relationship Level Gates: Content locked behind progression requirements  
3. Real-time Content Filtering: NSFW detection with character-appropriate responses

// Age-Based Content Matrix
Ages 13-15: Friendship conversations only
Ages 16-17: Mild romantic content at appropriate relationship levels
Ages 18+:   Full access to all content based on relationship progression
```
